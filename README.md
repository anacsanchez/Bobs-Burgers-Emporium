# Bob's Burgers Emporium

Bob's Burgers* Emporium is an e-commerce site that allows for the purchase of exclusive Bob's Burgers Specials.

[Bob's Burgers Emporium Beta Site](https://burgers-emporium.herokuapp.com/)

This site was developed in 10 days as a final project for the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Because Bob's Burgers Emporium was built for educational rather than commercial use, the site does not actually allow users to purchase burgers.

## App Functionality

Guests and registered users can browse burgers, add items to a cart, and place orders via Stripe. Visitors have the option of creating an account via local login or Google, allowing them to save their shopping cart and view their order history.

Administrative users can add, edit, and delete users, orders, burgers, and categories.
