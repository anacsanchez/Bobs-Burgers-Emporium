Project Name: Shopping Trifecta

Project Description: Selling burgers to the masses online

*This document describes our team social contract for this project*

Roles:
- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster
- Testmaster

Daily process:
- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
- New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
- Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- After lunch, have re-group meeting where we check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

Team expectations:
- We will keep work on nights and weekends to a minimum. Respecting flexible hours and each others’ preferred schedules.
- Slack, don’t tap! This will help avoid  interrupting a teammate’s train of thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally); None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Pairing will be used when we are stuck on a problem, but we will largely be working independently
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand; Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss - argue infrequently
- Message the group when you change what you are working on

Issues:
- If you are stuck:
  - Don’t struggle for more than a half-day
  - Bring up the issue at the next stand-up
  - Get help from teammates
  - If necessary, submit a help ticket

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  - Take 10-15 minute break
  - Give everyone the floor for 2 minutes to explain their position
  - Find a compromise
  - If no consensus is found, escalate to a fellow or instructor

- If you are frustrated
  - Take a walk or get some water
  - Hold a quick stand-up meeting, or bring frustrations up in scheduled stand-up
  - Give the frustrated person the floor for a couple of minutes to talk it out
  - Discuss potential solutions, careful to listen and avoid interruptions
  - Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
